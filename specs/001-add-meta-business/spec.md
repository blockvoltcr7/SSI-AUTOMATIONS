**Feature Branch**: `001-add-meta-business`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add Meta Business Suite Domain Verification Meta Tag to Next.js Project"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a business administrator, I need to verify ownership of the ssiautomations.com domain with Meta Business Suite so that I can access Meta's business features, run ads, and manage business assets associated with this domain.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the website is deployed with the verification meta tag, **When** viewing the page source of the homepage, **Then** the Meta domain verification tag should be present in the HTML head section
2. **Given** the verification tag is properly deployed, **When** initiating domain verification in Meta Business Suite, **Then** the verification process should complete successfully
3. **Given** the domain is verified, **When** checking Meta Business Suite domain settings, **Then** the domain status should show as "Verified"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the meta tag is malformed or contains incorrect content?
- How does system handle if multiple verification tags are present?
- What happens if the tag is removed after verification?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a Meta domain verification tag in the HTML head section of the homepage
- **FR-002**: The verification tag MUST contain the exact verification content: "yb8e406dpnvzbn2gxsmdivpf1sjpny5"
- **FR-003**: The verification tag MUST use the exact name attribute: "facebook-domain-verification"
- **FR-004**: The verification tag MUST be accessible to Meta's verification crawler when accessing https://ssiautomations.com
- **FR-005**: The verification tag MUST persist across deployments once added
- **FR-006**: System MUST render the tag in the initial HTML response (not client-side rendered)
- **FR-007**: The tag MUST be present only on the production domain (ssiautomations.com) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the tag also appear on staging/preview environments?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain any existing meta tags while adding the new verification tag
