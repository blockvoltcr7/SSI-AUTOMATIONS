# Data Model: Meta Business Suite Domain Verification

## Overview
This feature does not require any data models as it involves only a static meta tag addition.

## No Data Entities Required
- No database tables needed
- No data persistence required
- No user-specific data involved
- No state management needed

## Configuration
The only data involved is a static configuration value:

### Verification Token
- **Type**: String (constant)
- **Value**: `yb8e406dpnvzbn2gxsmdivpf1sjpny5`
- **Location**: Hardcoded in metadata configuration
- **Mutability**: Immutable after deployment

## Environment Variables
While not a data model, the following environment checks will be used:
- `NODE_ENV`: To determine if running in production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`: To verify production deployment (if using Vercel)

## Security Considerations
- The verification token is public by design (visible in HTML)
- No sensitive data exposure concerns
- No user data collection or storage
