# Web3 Authentication - Demo & Presentation Script

## 🎬 Executive Demo (5 Minutes)

### **Audience**: C-Suite, Product Managers, Investors

---

### **Opening (30 seconds)**

> "Today I'm excited to show you how we've modernized our authentication system with Web3 wallet integration. This technology eliminates passwords, reduces friction, and positions us at the forefront of Web3 adoption."

**Key Talking Points**:

- No passwords = Better security
- One-click sign-in = Better UX
- Web3-ready = Future-proof

---

### **Demo Flow (3 minutes)**

#### **Scene 1: The Problem (30 seconds)**

> "Traditional login requires users to create passwords, remember them, and wait for email verification. This creates friction and security risks."

**Show**: Traditional email/OTP flow (briefly)

---

#### **Scene 2: The Solution (2 minutes)**

**Step 1: Navigate to Login Page**

> "Here's our new login experience. Users can choose between traditional email or Web3 wallet authentication."

**Action**: Show login page with both options

---

**Step 2: Select Wallet**

> "When users click 'Select Wallet', they see all their installed wallets. This works with Phantom, Solflare, Ledger, and more."

**Action**: Click "Select Wallet" → Show wallet modal

---

**Step 3: Connect Wallet**

> "I'll select Phantom, the most popular Solana wallet. The wallet asks for permission to connect - this is a one-time step."

**Action**: Select Phantom → Approve connection

---

**Step 4: Sign In**

> "Now I simply click 'Sign in with Solana'. The wallet asks me to sign a message - this cryptographically proves I own this wallet without revealing my private key."

**Action**: Click "Sign in with Solana" → Show signature prompt

---

**Step 5: Success**

> "And just like that, I'm authenticated and redirected to my dashboard. No password, no email verification, just cryptographic proof of ownership."

**Action**: Sign message → Show dashboard

---

### **Impact Summary (30 seconds)**

> "This technology delivers three key benefits:"

1. **Security**: Eliminates password vulnerabilities and phishing attacks
2. **User Experience**: Reduces sign-in time from minutes to seconds
3. **Strategic Positioning**: Enables future Web3 features like NFT gating, token rewards, and DAO integration

---

### **Q&A Prep**

**Q: What if users don't have a wallet?**

> "We maintain traditional email/OTP authentication as a fallback. Users can choose the method that works best for them."

**Q: Is this secure?**

> "Yes. It uses the same cryptographic technology that secures billions of dollars in cryptocurrency. The private key never leaves the user's wallet."

**Q: What's the adoption rate?**

> "We're targeting Web3-native users initially, with plans to expand as wallet adoption grows. Current wallet penetration is ~5% of internet users but growing 200% year-over-year."

## 🔧 Technical Demo (15 Minutes)

### **Audience**: Engineering Teams, Technical Stakeholders

---

### **Opening (1 minute)**

> "I'll walk you through our Web3 authentication implementation, covering the architecture, code flow, and integration points. This is a production-ready system built on Supabase Auth and Solana Wallet Adapter."

---

### **Architecture Overview (3 minutes)**

**Show**: Architecture diagram from documentation

> "Our system has five main layers:"

1. **Frontend**: React components with Wallet Adapter integration
2. **Context Layer**: Solana wallet provider wrapping auth routes
3. **Business Logic**: Web3 authentication and metadata collection
4. **Data Access**: Supabase client/server utilities
5. **Middleware**: Session management and route protection

**Key Points**:

- Separation of concerns
- Server/client boundary management
- Cookie-based session storage

---

### **Code Walkthrough (8 minutes)**

#### **1. Wallet Provider Setup (2 minutes)**

**File**: `context/solana-wallet-provider.tsx`

```typescript
export const SolanaWalletProvider: FC<SolanaWalletProviderProps> = ({
  children,
}) => {
  const endpoint = useMemo(() => {
    return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL ||
           clusterApiUrl("mainnet-beta");
  }, []);

  const wallets = useMemo(
    () => [
      new PhantomWalletAdapter(),
      new SolflareWalletAdapter(),
      new TorusWalletAdapter(),
      new LedgerWalletAdapter(),
    ],
    [],
  );

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect={false}>
        <WalletModalProvider>{children}</WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
};
```

**Explain**:

- `ConnectionProvider`: Manages Solana RPC connection
- `WalletProvider`: Handles multi-wallet support
- `WalletModalProvider`: Provides pre-built UI
- `autoConnect: false`: User must explicitly connect

---

#### **2. Authentication Logic (3 minutes)**

**File**: `lib/supabase/web3.ts`

```typescript
export async function signInWithSolanaAdapter(wallet: WalletContextState) {
  try {
    const supabase = createClient();

    if (!wallet.connected || !wallet.publicKey) {
      return {
        data: null,
        error: "Wallet not connected. Please connect your wallet first.",
      };
    }

    const result = await supabase.auth.signInWithWeb3({
      chain: "solana",
      statement: "I accept the SSI Automations Terms of Service...",
      wallet: wallet as any,
    });

    if (result.error) {
      const errorMessage = result.error.message || "";
      const isUserRejection =
        errorMessage.includes("User rejected") ||
        errorMessage.includes("rejected the request");

      if (isUserRejection) {
        return {
          data: null,
          error:
            "Signature request was cancelled. Please try again when ready.",
        };
      }

      return { data: null, error: errorMessage };
    }

    return { data: result.data, error: null };
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Unexpected error during Solana sign-in:", error);
    return {
      data: null,
      error: "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.",
    };
  }
}
```

**Explain**:

- Validation before API call
- Graceful error handling (especially user rejection)
- Terms of Service statement injection
- Structured return format

---

#### **3. UI Component (2 minutes)**

**File**: `components/solana-wallet-button.tsx`

```typescript
export function SolanaWalletButton() {
  const wallet = useWallet();
  const router = useRouter();
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleSignIn = async () => {
    if (!wallet.connected || !wallet.publicKey) {
      setError("Please connect your wallet first...");
      return;
    }

    try {
      setIsLoading(true);
      setError(null);

      const { data, error: signInError } =
        await signInWithSolanaAdapter(wallet);

      if (signInError) {
        setError(signInError);
        return;
      }

      if (data?.session) {
        router.push("/dashboard");
      }
    } catch (e: any) {
      setError(e.message || "Failed to sign in");
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  // Render logic...
}
```

**Explain**:

- State management (loading, error)
- Conditional rendering based on wallet connection
- Error display with user-friendly messages
- Automatic redirect on success

---

#### **4. Middleware Protection (1 minute)**

**File**: `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`

```typescript
export async function updateSession(request: NextRequest) {
  let supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({ request });

  const supabase = createServerClient(/* ... */);

  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  const publicRoutes = ["/", "/login", "/otp", "/about", ...];
  const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.some(
    (route) => request.nextUrl.pathname === route ||
               request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith(`${route}/`)
  );

  if (!user && !isPublicRoute) {
    const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
    url.pathname = "/login";
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
  }

  return supabaseResponse;
}
```

**Explain**:

- Runs on every request
- Validates session and refreshes tokens
- Route protection logic
- Redirect unauthenticated users

---

### **Live Demo (2 minutes)**

**Action**: Run through complete authentication flow

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/login`
3. Open browser DevTools (Network tab)
4. Click "Select Wallet" → Show wallet selection
5. Connect Phantom → Show connection approval
6. Click "Sign in with Solana" → Show signature request
7. Sign message → Show network requests
8. Observe redirect to `/dashboard`
9. Show session cookies in DevTools

**Highlight**:

- Network requests to Supabase
- Cookie storage (HTTP-only, secure)
- Token structure (access + refresh)

---

### **Q&A Prep**

**Q: How do you handle token refresh?**

> "Middleware automatically calls `auth.getUser()` on every request, which triggers token refresh if the access token is expired. This happens transparently to the user."

**Q: What about mobile support?**

> "Mobile wallet support is limited to in-app browsers (like Phantom's built-in browser). For native mobile apps, we'd need to implement deep linking or WalletConnect."

**Q: Can you support multiple chains?**

> "Yes. The architecture is chain-agnostic. We can add Ethereum support by configuring additional wallet adapters and updating the `signInWithWeb3` call."

**Q: How do you prevent replay attacks?**

> "Supabase includes a nonce (timestamp) in the signature message, which prevents old signatures from being reused."
