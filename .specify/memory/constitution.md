# SSI Automations Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-First Architecture
Every feature MUST be implemented as a reusable React component with clear boundaries. Components must be self-contained with their own styles, types, and tests. No feature implementation without proper componentization - business logic must be separated from presentation logic through custom hooks and utilities.

### II. Type Safety & Documentation
TypeScript strict mode is mandatory for all code. Every exported function, component, and hook MUST have comprehensive type definitions. JSDoc comments required for public APIs. Props interfaces must be explicitly defined and exported for all components.

### III. Test Coverage Requirements
Minimum 80% code coverage for all new features. Critical paths require integration tests using Cypress or Playwright. Component testing mandatory for all UI components. API routes must have request/response validation tests. No deployment without passing test suites.

### IV. Performance & Accessibility
Core Web Vitals targets MUST be met: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1. All interactive elements require ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support. Images must use Next.js Image component with proper sizing. Code splitting required for routes over 50KB.

### V. Security & Data Protection
All user inputs MUST be validated on both client and server. API routes require authentication middleware except public endpoints. Sensitive data must never be exposed in client-side code or logs. Rate limiting required on all API endpoints. Environment variables must follow naming convention and be documented.

## Technical Standards

### Framework Conventions
- Next.js App Router patterns for all routing
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- API routes follow RESTful conventions with proper status codes
- Tailwind CSS for styling with component-specific module files when needed
- Shadcn/ui components as base building blocks

### Code Organization
- Features grouped by domain in `/app` directory
- Shared components in `/components` with atomic design principles
- Utilities and helpers in `/lib` directory
- Types centralized in `/types` directory
- API logic separated in `/app/api` routes

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
- All code requires peer review before merge
- Automated checks must pass: lint, type-check, tests
- Performance budget validation required
- Accessibility audit for UI changes
- Security review for authentication/data handling changes

### Deployment Pipeline
- Feature branches deploy to preview environments
- Main branch auto-deploys to staging
- Production deployment requires manual approval
- Rollback plan required for database migrations
- Monitoring alerts configured before feature release

## Governance

The Constitution supersedes all development practices and architectural decisions. Amendments require:
1. Written proposal with justification
2. Team review and discussion
3. Impact analysis on existing code
4. Migration plan if breaking changes
5. Documentation updates

All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance through automated checks where possible and manual review for principles that cannot be automated. Complexity additions must be justified against business value. The CLAUDE.md file serves as runtime development guidance for AI-assisted development.
